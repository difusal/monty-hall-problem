    <string name="help_problem">Here is the problem:\nSuppose you are on a game show, and you are given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?"</string>
    <string name="help_question">Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</string>
