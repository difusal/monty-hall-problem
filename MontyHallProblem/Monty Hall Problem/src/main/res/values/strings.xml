    <string name="help_intro">The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle.</string>
    <string name="help_problem">Here is the problem:\n\nSuppose you are on a game show, and you are given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?"\n\nIs it to your advantage to switch your choice?</string>
